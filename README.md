This report covers basic approaches to using <b>easily-understood machine learning techniques</b> to predict 
"overall player ratings"<span title="see footnote on clarification of overall ratings in FIFA">[^1]</span>
based on data obtained from the FIFA video games, with initial inference from real life football data. 

<b>KNN Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Voting Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor</b> 
algorithmic models are used in this research. Evaluation methods such as <b>Lasso, Ridge, Cross-Validation, 
and Multiple KNN value comparison</b> are explored.
